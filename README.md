= jmespath.js

This is a javascript implementation of JMESPath.

See http://jmespath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ for more info.

Remaining work:

* filters.json (needs deep equality for literals)
* function.json (needs entire implementation)
* pipe.json (actually implemented but compliance tests uses functions)
* syntax.json (misc edge cases).
